Source code for computing the Sato-Tate groups and moment statistics for two families of Jacobian varieties: Jac(y^2=x^{2^m}-c) and Jac(y^2=x^{2^{d}+1}-cx).

Authors: M. Emory and H. Goodson

This code is based on the authors' paper: "Nondegeneracy and Sato-Tate Distributions of Two Families of Jacobian Varieties" (arXiv 2024)
